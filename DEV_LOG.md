## 2026-07-09 — Session start, direction pivot

- **Unity direction abandoned before any code was written.** The original v1 brief targeted
  Unity/URP. Mid-setup (a bare `-createProject` had just finished; zero custom assets/code),
  the v2 spec arrived superseding it: vanilla JS/HTML5 Canvas top-down course + Three.js
  walkable pro shop + Electron shell. Deleted the bare Unity-generated folders entirely —
  they contained no work. This repo is JS-only from the first commit.
- **Skipped the brainstorming/planning skill workflows.** The brief is a complete,
  authoritative design spec and explicitly forbids stopping for questions; user instructions
  take precedence over skill workflows. Logged here per that same instruction. The
  test-driven-development skill IS being used for all sim modules, since headless unit
  testing is the named primary verification method.
- **Mirroring GlassWaterV2 conventions** (sibling repo, the "proven approach" the brief
  names): `main.cjs` + `preload.cjs` Electron shell with context isolation and IPC
  save/load, `type: module` ESM app code, import-mapped vendored Three.js, zero-dependency
  static dev server (`tools/serve.cjs`, port **8447** here to avoid clashing with
  GlassWater's 8437), `node --test` for headless tests, `--dev` flag opening remote
  debugging on **9223** for Chrome DevTools MCP QA.
- **Dependencies pinned to the proven pair**: electron ^33.2.0, three ^0.185.1 — same
  versions GlassWaterV2 ships with on this machine, no reason to gamble on newer majors.

## 2026-07-09 — Core architecture decisions (before Phase 1 code)

- **Single serializable `GameState`** plain-data object; all sim modules are plain ESM
  functions operating on it (`tick`, commands). Rendering/UI read state and issue commands;
  nothing in `src/sim/` touches DOM/canvas — that's what makes `node --test` cover the
  entire simulation.
- **Seeded RNG (mulberry32) carried in state** so simulation runs are reproducible in tests.
- **Course model is a cell grid**: 120×80 cells, 1 cell = 8×8 yd (course footprint
  960×640 yd — plausible for a compact 9-hole muni). Per cell: zone type (out-of-play /
  rough / fairway / green / tee / bunker / water / path), elevation (float, yards),
  and later per-cell turf state. Zone *sections* ("Green 3", "Fairway 5 section 2") are
  derived as contiguous same-zone blobs and auto-associated to the nearest hole — no manual
  cell-to-hole assignment busywork for the player, and it keeps the editor free-form.
- **Holes** are tee marker + pin position (pin must sit on green cells) with par derived
  from tee→pin distance (real-world par bands: <251yd par 3, 251–470 par 4, >470 par 5).
- **Terrain editing is plan-then-confirm** ("Course Works" mode): paint changes as a ghost
  plan with an itemized cost, then confirm (charges cash, applies, and puts affected open
  holes into renovation downtime) or cancel. Rationale: the spec demands renovation feel
  like a real business decision, not a free undo button — batching edits into a confirmed
  project is both better game feel and cleaner cost/downtime accounting than per-brushstroke
  charges. There is deliberately NO free undo after confirm.
- **Game calendar**: 4 seasons × 24 days = 96-day year. Day runs 6:00–20:00 for play.
  1 real second = 10 game minutes at 1× speed (a full day ≈ 84 s), with pause/1×/4×/16×.
- **Money is integer cents avoided** — plain dollars as floats rounded to cents on display;
  amounts in this game are large enough that float noise is irrelevant, and it keeps
  balance code readable. (Logged in case a future accountant disagrees.)
