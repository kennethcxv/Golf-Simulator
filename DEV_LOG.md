# FAIRWAY STATE — DEV LOG

Running log of every judgment call made during autonomous development, with reasoning.

## 2026-07-09 — Session start, direction pivot

- **Unity direction abandoned before any code was written.** The original v1 brief targeted
  Unity/URP. Mid-setup (a bare `-createProject` had just finished; zero custom assets/code),
  the v2 spec arrived superseding it: vanilla JS/HTML5 Canvas top-down course + Three.js
  walkable pro shop + Electron shell. Deleted the bare Unity-generated folders entirely —
  they contained no work. This repo is JS-only from the first commit.
- **Skipped the brainstorming/planning skill workflows.** The brief is a complete,
  authoritative design spec and explicitly forbids stopping for questions; user instructions
  take precedence over skill workflows. Logged here per that same instruction. The
  test-driven-development skill IS being used for all sim modules, since headless unit
  testing is the named primary verification method.
- **Mirroring GlassWaterV2 conventions** (sibling repo, the "proven approach" the brief
  names): `main.cjs` + `preload.cjs` Electron shell with context isolation and IPC
  save/load, `type: module` ESM app code, import-mapped vendored Three.js, zero-dependency
  static dev server (`tools/serve.cjs`, port **8447** here to avoid clashing with
  GlassWater's 8437), `node --test` for headless tests, `--dev` flag opening remote
  debugging on **9223** for Chrome DevTools MCP QA.
- **Dependencies pinned to the proven pair**: electron ^33.2.0, three ^0.185.1 — same
  versions GlassWaterV2 ships with on this machine, no reason to gamble on newer majors.

## 2026-07-09 — Core architecture decisions (before Phase 1 code)

- **Single serializable `GameState`** plain-data object; all sim modules are plain ESM
  functions operating on it (`tick`, commands). Rendering/UI read state and issue commands;
  nothing in `src/sim/` touches DOM/canvas — that's what makes `node --test` cover the
  entire simulation.
- **Seeded RNG (mulberry32) carried in state** so simulation runs are reproducible in tests.
- **Course model is a cell grid**: 120×80 cells, 1 cell = 8×8 yd (course footprint
  960×640 yd — plausible for a compact 9-hole muni). Per cell: zone type (out-of-play /
  rough / fairway / green / tee / bunker / water / path), elevation (float, yards),
  and later per-cell turf state. Zone *sections* ("Green 3", "Fairway 5 section 2") are
  derived as contiguous same-zone blobs and auto-associated to the nearest hole — no manual
  cell-to-hole assignment busywork for the player, and it keeps the editor free-form.
- **Holes** are tee marker + pin position (pin must sit on green cells) with par derived
  from tee→pin distance (real-world par bands: <251yd par 3, 251–470 par 4, >470 par 5).
- **Terrain editing is plan-then-confirm** ("Course Works" mode): paint changes as a ghost
  plan with an itemized cost, then confirm (charges cash, applies, and puts affected open
  holes into renovation downtime) or cancel. Rationale: the spec demands renovation feel
  like a real business decision, not a free undo button — batching edits into a confirmed
  project is both better game feel and cleaner cost/downtime accounting than per-brushstroke
  charges. There is deliberately NO free undo after confirm.
- **Game calendar**: 4 seasons × 24 days = 96-day year. Day runs 6:00–20:00 for play.
  1 real second = 10 game minutes at 1× speed (a full day ≈ 84 s), with pause/1×/4×/16×.
- **Money is integer cents avoided** — plain dollars as floats rounded to cents on display;
  amounts in this game are large enough that float noise is irrelevant, and it keeps
  balance code readable. (Logged in case a future accountant disagrees.)

## 2026-07-09 — Phase 1 complete (shell + course view + terrain editing)

- **TDD throughout the sim layer**: 45 headless tests written first (watched fail), then
  implemented green: utils/RNG, calendar, course model (grid/sections/holes/par/design
  rating), plan-confirm editing (costs, corridor-based renovation detection, tee/pin ops,
  daily countdowns), Willow Creek starting course, GameState serialization.
- **Willow Creek Municipal layout** is hand-routed in code (two loops off the clubhouse,
  par 34, ~2,380 yd, three par 3s, one par 5, pond guarding the par-3 5th, six bunkers)
  and painted deterministically from the game seed. Its scruffiness is intentionally in
  the *condition* dimension (arriving with the Phase 2 turf sim), not the architecture —
  a complete-if-modest 9-holer whose Design score (~86) is honest; the "fixer-upper" pain
  will come from turf health multiplying into the overall rating.
- **Design rating formula components** (45 playable holes / 10 par variety / 10 length /
  8 bunkering / 6 water / 8 green sizing / 8 land movement / 5 fairway coverage; holes
  under renovation count 0.4, construction 0.2). Judgment-call weights, tuned later.
- **Renovation corridor rule**: a confirmed edit within 4 cells of an open hole's tee→pin
  line closes that hole for `ceil(cells/6)` days (realistic; /12 relaxed), clamped 2–21.
  Tee/pin moves on an open hole: flat 3 days (realistic) / 2 (relaxed). New holes build
  for 5/3 days once valid. If renovation ends and the hole is incomplete (green dug up),
  it falls to `unbuilt` rather than reopening — verified by unit test.
- **Browser QA pass (Playwright)**: menu → new game → works mode → drag-painted a 32-cell
  bunker strip ($8,000 = 32×$250 exact) → plan bar warned "closes H1 4d, H7 2d" →
  confirmed → cash/badges/grey-pins correct → 16× fast-forward 6 days → holes reopened →
  reload → Continue restored Day 7 from autosave with works persisted → inspect panel
  ("Pond") → slot save. Zero console errors/warnings across the session.
- **Bugs found by QA, fixed**: HUD crashed reading `state.clubName` before any game
  existed (boot-order); clock rendered raw fractional minutes ("7:19.20299… AM") — floor
  in formatClock; hint bar overlapped the plan bar (hidden in works mode now).
- **`window.__fw` debug hook** exposes the app object for automated QA — kept
  deliberately, it's read-mostly and invaluable for driving later-phase tests.
- **Electron smoke-tested** (launches, stays alive, clean teardown). Deep native-bridge
  QA (userData save files) deferred to a later phase via CDP attach; the renderer code is
  byte-identical to the browser path and the bridge mirrors GlassWaterV2's proven 30-line
  pattern.
- **CSP meta deferred to Phase 7** (needs an importmap hash dance; zero third-party code
  runs meanwhile). Logged in KNOWN_ISSUES.
